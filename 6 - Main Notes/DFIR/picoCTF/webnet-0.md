##### Description:
The CTF Challenge provided a `pcap and RSA key` The same as the [[webnet-1]]

### Terminal:
Almost the same as [[webnet-1]] but this time the file I downloaded contained some errors that does not contain the RSA keys which should start with `--BEGIN--` and `--END--` so I downloaded the file on my host computer and then copied it in notepad to gather it properly

#### Note
I used `ChatGPT` in hint-mode again but this time I asked him why the provided `key` is not working, so I used the `cat` command and saw the problem pointed by `GPT`
