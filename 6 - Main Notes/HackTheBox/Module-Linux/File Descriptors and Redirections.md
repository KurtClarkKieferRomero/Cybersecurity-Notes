## File Descriptors and Redirections

A file descriptor (FD) in Linux/Unix OS is a *reference*, maintained by the kernel, that allows the system to mange Input/Output (I/O)
Essentially it keeps track which I/O connections are active
1. Data Stream for Input
	`STDIN - 0`
2. Data Stream for Output
	`STDOUT - 1`
3. Data stream for Output that relates to an error occuring
	`STDERR - 2`
